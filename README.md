# Cognitromics

Human-centered AI research and development project. Cognitromics utilizes an Artificial Cognitive System and a genomics approach to create always-on (resembling living) human-like cognitive machines that contribute to making peopleÂ´s lives easier by automating repetitive tasks, while preserving knowledge/data ownership and the environment.

Just mentioning repetitive tasks is a broad concept; Cognitromics aims to reproduce human learning flexibility and versatility in a way that any procedural task and logic could be potentially reproduced by a "congnitron" after undergoing a classic teacher-student training session(s). We define a cognitron as a Compound AI system that integrates AI models orchestrated by a Machine Cognitive Architecture (MCA). As a cognitron can inhabit a local environment without internet access, it ensures compliance with data privacy regulations, reduces the carbon footprint, and improves the scalability of AI.
