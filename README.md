# Cognitromics

Human-centered AI research and development project. Cognitromics utilizes an Artificial Cognitive System (ACS) and a genomics approach to create always-on (resembling living) human-like cognitive machines that contribute to human development, while promoting data privacy and AI carbon footprint reduction.

Cognitromics attempts to emulate human learning flexibility and versatility in a way that any procedural task and logic could potentially be reproduced by a "cognitron". We define a cognitron as a Compound AI system that integrates AI models orchestrated by a Machine Cognitive Architecture (MCA). In theory, any machine and deep learning model could be learned by a cognitron when its MCA efficiently incorporates them into its own AI model corpus. In other words, it is an AI model unifier supported by a distributed system of interdependent cognitive elements specialized in well-specified functions of the MCA, so the readaptation to the physical-digital environment or context seamlessly happens. As a cognitron inhabits a local environment (i.e., personal computer or dedicated on-premise hardware connected to a series of sensors or information sources) without the need for an internet connection, it ensures compliance with data privacy regulations, reduces the carbon footprint, and improves the scalability of AI.

The first step is to develop a basic prototype that assembles an MCA composed of three modules:
- Attention: operates the MCA processes like memory and CL, and handles human requests.
- Memory: stores the machine genome (instructions for every module to work properly and in sync) and knowledge (AI models learned by the CL).
- Continuous learning (CL): adds knowledge to the memory when training AI models fed by the user through the Attention module, or builds on top of an already learned model.

The first experiment to be done is summarized as follows:
1) The user trains an MLP-based model for learning a sequence of numbers
2) The user asks the cognitron to learn the sequence of numbers recognition model
3) The user asks to retrieve the pre-learned or learned sequence of numbers
4) The user requests the cognitron for learning a new sequence of numbers
5) The cognitron learns the new sequence and returns the results of the learning to the user
6) Go to step 3
