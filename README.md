# Cognitromics

Human-centered AI research and development project. Cognitromics utilizes an Artificial Cognitive System (ACS) and a genomics approach to create always-on (resembling living) human-like cognitive machines that contribute to making peopleÂ´s lives easier by automating repetitive tasks, while preserving knowledge/data ownership and the environment.

Just mentioning repetitive tasks may sound like a too broad concept; however, Cognitromics aims to reproduce human learning flexibility and versatility in a way that any procedural task and logic could be potentially reproduced by a "congnitron" after undergoing a classic teacher-student-in-a-classroom training session(s). We define a cognitron as a Compound AI system that integrates AI models orchestrated by a Machine Cognitive Architecture (MCA). As a cognitron can also inhabit a local environment (i.e., personal computer or dedicated on-premise hardware) without an internet connection, it ensures compliance with data privacy regulations, reduces the carbon footprint, and improves the scalability of AI.

The first step is to develop a basic prototype that assembles an MCA composed of three modules:
- Attention: operates the MCA processes like memory and CL, and handles human requests.
- Memory: stores the machine genome (instructions for every module to work properly and in sync) and knowledge (AI models learned by the CL).
- Continuous learning (CL): adds knowledge to the memory when training AI models fed by the user into the Attention.

The first experiment to be done could be summarized as follows:
1) The user trains an MLP-based model for learning a sequence of numbers
2) The user asks the cognitron to learn the sequence of numbers recognition model
3) The cognitron learns the sequence and returns the results of the learning to the user
4) The user asks for the learned sequence of numbers
5) Go to step 2
