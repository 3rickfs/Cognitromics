## About the project
Nowadays, AI has been adopted by millions of people, even governments have begun to encourage and regulate the use of LLM-based chatbots in schools. This change comes with certain drawbacks that impact people's employment, data privacy, and intellectual property, as well as the environment and natural resources like water. As AI is a growing industry, it will become more popular over time, meaning that the problems may get worse if it remains unattended. 

A more interesting value is not replacing people with AI to "automate" processes and reduce costs in a company, but giving them a tool that makes them more collaborative, creative, and impactful, so they can, as a team, target and achieve better project outcomes.

The name of the tool we proposed is Cognitromics, a human-centered AI research and development project. Cognitromics utilizes an Artificial Cognitive System (ACS) and a genomics approach to create always-on (resembling living) human-like cognitive machines that contribute to human development, while promoting data privacy and AI carbon footprint reduction.  

Cognitromics attempts to emulate human learning flexibility and versatility in a way that any procedural task and logic could potentially be reproduced by a "cognitron". We define a cognitron as a Compound AI system that integrates AI models orchestrated by a Machine Cognitive Architecture (MCA). In theory, any machine and deep learning model could be learned by a cognitron when its MCA efficiently incorporates them into its own AI model corpus. In other words, it is an AI model unifier supported by a distributed system of interdependent cognitive elements specialized in well-specified MCA functions, so the readaptation to the physical-digital environment or context seamlessly happens. As a cognitron inhabits a local environment (i.e., personal computer or dedicated on-premise hardware connected to a series of sensors or information sources) without the need for an internet connection, it ensures compliance with data privacy regulations, reduces the carbon footprint, and improves the scalability of AI.

A cognitron may be seen as a cognitive agent that goes beyond the "user-request-and-AI-prediction-answer" communication; it becomes prescriptive instead of reactive, making use of abductive reasoning to suggest, based on observations, possible ways of understanding and solving real-world problems. It is more like a human-AI collaboration, though, it leverages Hybrid Intelligence to enhance both AI and user knowledge. To make the learning experience more insightful, the cognitron might develop an artificial emotional intelligence. In this way, the user experience is as smooth as possible, as if talking with a friend.

## Let´s keep it as simple as possible

### A basic MCA prototype
The first step is to develop a basic prototype that assembles an MCA composed of three modules:
- Attention: operates the MCA processes like memory and CL, and handles human requests.
- Memory: stores the machine genome (instructions for every module to work correctly and in sync) and knowledge (AI model corpus built by the CL).
- Continuous learning (CL): adds knowledge to the memory when training AI models fed by the user through the Attention module, or builds on top of an already learned model.

### Cognitive machine Hello World
The first experiment is summarized as follows:
1) The user trains an MLP-based model for learning a sequence of numbers
2) The user asks the cognitron to learn the sequence of numbers recognition model
3) The user asks to retrieve the pre-learned or learned sequence of numbers
4) The user requests the cognitron for learning a new sequence of numbers
5) The cognitron learns the new sequence and returns the results of the learning to the user
6) Go to step 3
