# Cognitron

Cognitron is an Artificial Human Intelligence (AHI) that leverages a basic Machine Cognitive Architecture (MCA) to learn and perform tasks requested by humans. As this is an AHI, an always-on interaction with the context is promoted. In this way it may collect new context information in a local way (without sharing anything with remote servers), learn from it, remember, and act upon the changing environment accordingly to its human owner. 

The initial prototype of this AHI breaks down the complex Human Cognitive Architecture (HCA) in only three components: attention, memory and learning (the basic MCA). It will eventually grow in components as the next steps are achieved folowing multiple tests.

As you may have noticed, there is a folder named Conception. This module aims to build the AHI image up. The AHI image is the seminal structure to give birth cognitrons which inhabit local or cloud environments, and develop their own cognitive modules as per the experiences they confront with alongside or on behalf of their human owners.

Technically, the AHI image is a docker-powered, linux-based OS image build using Packer, and the cognitron deployment is a container.
