# Cognitron

Cognitron is an Artificial Human Intelligence (AHI) that leverages a basic Machine Cognitive Architecture (MCA) to learn and perform tasks requested by humans. As this is an AHI, an always-on interaction with the context is promoted. In this way, it may locally collect new context information (without sharing anything with remote servers), learn from it, remember, and act upon the changing environment accordingly to its human owner. 

The initial prototype of this AHI breaks down the complex Human Cognitive Architecture (HCA) in only three components: attention, memory, and learning (the basic MCA). It will eventually grow in components as the following steps are achieved, following multiple tests.

As you may have noticed, there is a folder named Conception. This module aims to build the AHI image. The AHI image is the seminal structure that gives birth to cognitrons, which inhabit local or cloud environments and develop their cognitive modules based on the experiences they confront alongside or on behalf of their human owners.

Technically, the AHI image is a Docker-powered, Linux-based OS image built using Packer, and the cognitron deployment is a container.
